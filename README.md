Monolith to Microservices with Docker and AWS Fargate
====================================================

Welcome to the Container Immersion Day Labs!

In this lab, you'll deploy a basic nodejs monolithic application using Auto Scaling & Application Load Balancer. In subsquent labs you would containerize this app using Docker and then use Amazon ECS to break this app in more manageable microservices. Let's get started!

### Requirements:

* AWS account - if you don't have one, it's easy and free to [create one](https://aws.amazon.com/).
* AWS IAM account with elevated privileges allowing you to interact with CloudFormation, IAM, EC2, ECS, ECR, ELB/ALB, VPC, CodeDeploy, CloudWatch, Cloud9. [Learn how](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html).
* Familiarity with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [AWS](httpts://aws.amazon.com) - *not required but a bonus*.

### What you'll do:

* **Lab Setup:** [Setup working environment on AWS](#lets-begin)
* **Lab 1:** [Containerize the monolith](#lab-1---containerize-the-monolith)
* **Lab 2:** [Deploy the container using AWS Fargate](#lab-2---deploy-your-container-using-ecrecs)
* **Lab 3:** [Break the monolith into microservices](#lab-3---break-the-monolith)
* **Lab 4:** [CodeDeploy Blue/Green deployments](#lab-4-codedeploy-blue-green-deployments)
* **Cleanup** [Put everything away nicely](#lab-cleanup)


### IMPORTANT: Lab Cleanup

You will be deploying infrastructure on AWS which will have an associated cost. When you're done with the lab, [follow the steps at the very end of the instructions](#lab-cleanup) to make sure everything is cleaned up and avoid unnecessary charges.


## Let's Begin!

### Lab Setup:

1. Open the CloudFormation launch template link below in a new tab. The link will load the CloudFormation Dashboard and start the stack creation process in the chosen region:
   
    Click on one of the **Deploy to AWS** icons below to region to stand up the core lab infrastructure.

| Region | Launch Template |
| ------------ | ------------- | 
**Oregon** (us-west-2) | [![Launch Stack into Oregon with CloudFormation](/images/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=container-labs&templateURL=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aajolly-labs/core-setup.yml)  
**N.Virginia** (us-east-1) | [![Launch Stack into N.Virginia with CloudFormation](/images/deploy-to-aws.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=container-labs&templateURL=https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/aajolly-labs/core-setup.yml)  


2. The template will automatically bring you to the CloudFormation Dashboard and start the stack creation process in the specified region. Give the stack a name that is unique within your account, and proceed through the wizard to launch the stack. Leave all options at their default values, but make sure to check the box to allow CloudFormation to create IAM roles on your behalf:

    ![IAM resources acknowledgement](images/00-cf-create.png)

    See the *Events* tab for progress on the stack launch. You can also see details of any problems here if the launch fails. Proceed to the next step once the stack status advances to "CREATE_COMPLETE".

3. Access the AWS Cloud9 Environment created by CloudFormation:

    On the AWS Console home page, type **Cloud9** into the service search bar and select it. Find the environment named like "Project-***STACK_NAME***":

    ![Cloud9 project selection](images/00-cloud9-select.png)

    When you open the IDE, you'll be presented with a welcome screen that looks like this:
    ![cloud9-welcome](images/00-cloud9-welcome.png)

    On the left pane (Blue), any files downloaded to your environment will appear here in the file tree. In the middle (Red) pane, any documents you open will show up here. Test this out by double clicking on README.md in the left pane and edit the file by adding some arbitrary text. Then save it by clicking File and Save. Keyboard shortcuts will work as well. On the bottom, you will see a bash shell (Yellow). For the remainder of the lab, use this shell to enter all commands. You can also customize your Cloud9 environment by changing themes, moving panes around, etc. (if you like the dark theme, you can select it by clicking the gear icon in the upper right, then "Themes", and choosing the dark theme).

4. Clone the Container Immersion Day Repository:

    In the bottom panel of your new Cloud9 IDE, you will see a terminal command line terminal open and ready to use.  Run the following git command in the terminal to clone the necessary code to complete this tutorial:

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/aajolly/container-immersion-day-15-05-2019.git
    ```

    After cloning the repository, you'll see that your project explorer now includes the files cloned.

    In the terminal, change directory to the subdirectory for this lab in the repo:

    ```
    $ cd container-immersion-day-15-05-2019/lab-1
    ```

5. Run some additional automated setup steps with the `setup` script:

    ```
    $ script/setup
    ```

    This script will delete some unneeded Docker images to free up disk space, update aws-cli version and update some packages.  Make sure you see the "Success!" message when the script completes.


## About the monolith
### Basic Node.js Server

This is an example of a basic monolithic node.js service that has been designed to run directly on a server, without a container.

### Architecture

Since Node.js programs run a single threaded event loop it is necessary to use the node `cluster` functionality in order to get maximum usage out of a multi-core server.

In this example `cluster` is used to spawn one worker process per core, and the processes share a single port using round robin load balancing built into Node.js

We use an Application Load Balancer to round robin requests across multiple servers, providing horizontal scaling.

![Reference diagram of the basic node application deployment](/images/monolithic-no-container.png)

Get the ALB DNS name from cloudformation outputs stored in the file `cfn-output.json` and make sure the following calls work

    <pre>
    curl http://<<ALB_DNS_NAME>>
    curl http://<<ALB_DNS_NAME>>/api
    curl http://<<ALB_DNS_NAME>>/api/users | jq '.'
    <pre>

## Lab 1 - Containerize the monolith

The current infrastructure has always been running directly on EC2 VMs. Our first step will be to modernize how our code is packaged by containerizing the current Mythical Mysfits adoption platform, which we'll also refer to as the monolith application.  To do this, you will create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), which is essentially a recipe for [Docker](https://aws.amazon.com/docker) to build a container image.  You'll use your [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) development environment to author the Dockerfile, build the container image, and run it to confirm it's able to process adoptions.

[Containers](https://aws.amazon.com/what-are-containers/) are a way to package software (e.g. web server, proxy, batch process worker) so that you can run your code and all of its dependencies in a resource isolated process. You might be thinking, "Wait, isn't that a virtual machine (VM)?" Containers virtualize the operating system, while VMs virtualize the hardware. Containers provide isolation, portability and repeatability, so your developers can easily spin up an environment and start building without the heavy lifting.  More importantly, containers ensure your code runs in the same way anywhere, so if it works on your laptop, it will also work in production.

### Here's what you're going to work on in lab 1:

![Lab 1 Architecture](images/01-arch.png)

1. Review the Dockerfile

2. Build the image using the [Docker build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/) command.

    This command needs to be run in the same directory where your Dockerfile is. **Note the trailing period** which tells the build command to look in the current directory for the Dockerfile.

    <pre>
    $ docker build -t api .
    </pre>

    You now have a Docker image built. The -t flag names the resulting container image. List your docker images and you'll see the "api" image in the list. Here's a sample output, note the api image in the list:

    <pre>
    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
    api                 latest              6a7abc1cc4c3        7 minutes ago       67.6MB
    mhart/alpine-node   8                   135ddefd2040        3 weeks ago         66MB
    </pre>

    *Note: Your output will not be exactly like this, but it will be similar.*

    Notice the image is also tagged as "latest".  This is the default behavior if you do not specify a tag of your own, but you can use this as a freeform way to identify an image, e.g. api:1.2 or api:experimental.  This is very convenient for identifying your images and correlating an image with a branch/version of code as well.

3. Run the docker container and test the application running as a container:

    Use the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) command to run your image; the -p flag is used to map the host listening port to the container listening port.

    <pre>
    $ docker run --name monolith-container -p 3000:3000 api
    </pre>


    To test the basic functionality of the monolith service, query the service using a utility like [cURL](https://localhost:3000/api/threads), which is bundled with Cloud9.

    Click on the plus sign next to your tabs and choose **New Terminal** or click **Window** -> **New Terminal** from the Cloud9 menu to open a new shell session to run the following curl command.

    <pre>
    $ curl http://localhost:3000/api/users
    </pre>

    You should see a JSON array with data about threads.

    Switch back to the original shell tab where you're running the monolith container to check the output from the monolith.

    The monolith container runs in the foreground with stdout/stderr printing to the screen, so when the request is received, you should see a `GET`.

    Here is sample output:

    <pre>
    GET /api/users - 3
    </pre>

    In the tab you have the running container, type **Ctrl-C** to stop the running container.  Notice, the container ran in the foreground with stdout/stderr printing to the console.  In a production environment, you would run your containers in the background and configure some logging destination.  We'll worry about logging later, but you can try running the container in the background using the -d flag.

    <pre>
    $ docker run --name monolith-container -d -p 3000:3000 api
    </pre>

    List running docker containers with the [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/) command to make sure the monolith is running.

    <pre>
    $ docker ps
    </pre>

    <pre>
    $ docker logs <b><i>CONTAINER_ID or CONTAINER_NAME</i></b>
    </pre>

    Here's sample output from the above command:

    <pre>
    $ docker logs monolith-container
    Worker started
    Worker started
    GET /api/users - 3
    </pre>

4. Now that you have a working Docker image, you can tag and push the image to [Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/).  ECR is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. In the next lab, we'll use ECS to pull your image from ECR.

    Create an ECR repository using the aws cli
    
    

    Tag and push your container image to the monolith repository.

    <pre>
    $ docker tag monolith-service:latest <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:latest
    $ docker push <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:latest
    </pre>

    When you issue the push command, Docker pushes the layers up to ECR.

    Here's sample output from these commands:

    <pre>
    $ docker tag monolith-service:latest 873896820536.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mysfit-mono-oa55rnsdnaud:latest
    $ docker push 873896820536.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mysfit-mono-oa55rnsdnaud:latest
    The push refers to a repository [873896820536.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/mysfit-mono-oa55rnsdnaud:latest]
    0f03d692d842: Pushed
    ddca409d6822: Pushed
    d779004749f3: Pushed
    4008f6d92478: Pushed
    e0c4f058a955: Pushed
    7e33b38be0e9: Pushed
    b9c7536f9dd8: Pushed

    </pre>

    *Note: Typically, you'd have to log into your ECR repo. However, you did not need to authenticate docker with ECR because the [Amazon ECR Credential Helper](https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-ecr-credential-helper) has been installed and configured for you on the Cloud9 Environment.  This was done earlier when you ran the setup script. You can read more about the credentials helper in this [article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/authenticating-amazon-ecr-repositories-for-docker-cli-with-credential-helper/).*

    If you refresh the ECR repository page in the console, you'll see a new image uploaded and tagged as latest.

    ![ECR push complete](images/01-ecr-push-complete.png)

### Checkpoint:
At this point, you should have a working container for the monolith codebase stored in an ECR repository and ready to deploy with ECS in the next lab.

[*^ back to the top*](#monolith-to-microservices-with-docker-and-aws-fargate)

## Lab 2 - Deploy your container using ECR/ECS

Deploying individual containers is not difficult.  However, when you need to coordinate many container deployments, a container management tool like ECS can greatly simplify the task (no pun intended).

ECS refers to a JSON formatted template called a [Task Definition](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html) that describes one or more containers making up your application or service.  The task definition is the recipe that ECS uses to run your containers as a **task** on your EC2 instances or AWS Fargate.

<details>
<summary>INFO: What is a task?</summary>
A task is a running set of containers on a single host. You may hear or see 'task' and 'container' used interchangeably. Often, we refer to tasks instead of containers because a task is the unit of work that ECS launches and manages on your cluster. A task can be a single container, or multiple containers that run together.

Fun fact: a task is very similar to a Kubernetes 'pod'.
</details>

Most task definition parameters map to options and arguments passed to the [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) command which means you can describe configurations like which container image(s) you want to use, host:container port mappings, cpu and memory allocations, logging, and more.

In this lab, you will create a task definition to serve as a foundation for deploying the containerized adoption platform stored in ECR with ECS. You will be using the [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) launch type, which let's you run containers without having to manage servers or other infrastructure. Fargate containers launch with a networking mode called [awsvpc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html), which gives ECS tasks the same networking properties of EC2 instances.  Tasks will essentially receive their own [elastic network interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html).  This offers benefits like task-specific security groups.  Let's get started!

![Lab 2 Architecture](images/02-arch.png)

*Note: You will use the AWS Management Console for this lab, but remember that you can programmatically accomplish the same thing using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or CloudFormation.*

### Instructions:

1. Create an ECS task definition that describes what is needed to run the monolith.

    The CloudFormation template you ran at the beginning of the workshop created some placeholder ECS resources running a simple "Hello World" NGINX container. (You can see this running now at the public endpoint for the ALB also created by CloudFormation available in `cfn-output.json`.) We'll begin to adapt this placeholder infrastructure to run the monolith by creating a new "Task Definition" referencing the container built in the previous lab.

    In the AWS Management Console, navigate to [Task Definitions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/taskDefinitions) in the ECS dashboard. Find the Task Definition named <code>Monolith-Definition-<b><i>STACK_NAME</i></b></code>, select it, and click "Create new revision". Select the "monolith-service" container under "Container Definitions", and update "Image" to point to the Image URI of the monolith container that you just pushed to ECR (something like `018782361163.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/mysfit-mono-oa55rnsdnaud:latest`).

    ![Edit container example](images/02-task-def-edit-container.png)

2. Check the CloudWatch logging settings in the container definition.

    In the previous lab, you attached to the running container to get *stdout*, but no one should be doing that in production and it's good operational practice to implement a centralized logging solution.  ECS offers integration with [CloudWatch logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) through an awslogs driver that can be enabled in the container definition.

    Verify that under "Storage and Logging", the "log driver" is set to "awslogs".

    The Log configuration should look something like this:

    ![CloudWatch Logs integration](images/02-awslogs.png)

    Click "Update" to save the container settings and then "Create" to create the Task Definition revision.

3. Run the task definition using the [Run Task](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_run_task.html) method.

    You should be at the task definition view where you can do things like create a new revision or invoke certain actions.  In the **Actions** dropdown, select **Run Task** to launch your container.

    ![Run Task](images/02-run-task.png)

    Configure the following fields:

    * **Launch Type** - select **Fargate**
    * **Cluster** - select your workshop cluster from the dropdown menu
    * **Task Definition** - select the task definition you created from the dropdown menu

    In the "VPC and security groups" section, enter the following:

    * **Cluster VPC** - Your workshop VPC, named like <code>Mysfits-VPC-<b><i>STACK_NAME</i></b></code>
    * **Subnets** - Select a public subnet, such as <code>Mysfits-PublicOne-<b><i>STACK_NAME</i></b></code>
    * **Security goups** - The default is fine, but you can confirm that it allows inbound traffic on port 80
    * **Auto-assign public IP** - "ENABLED"

    Leave all remaining fields as their defaults and click **Run Task**.

    You'll see the task start in the **PENDING** state (the placeholder NGINX task is still running as well).

    ![Task state](images/02-task-pending.png)

    In a few seconds, click on the refresh button until the task changes to a **RUNNING** state.

    ![Task state](images/02-task-running.png)

4. Test the running task by using cURL from your Cloud9 environment to send a simple GET request.

    First we need to determine the IP of your task. When using the "Fargate" launch type, each task gets its own ENI and Public/Private IP address. Click on the ID of the task you just launched to go to the detail page for the task. Note down the Public IP address to use with your curl command.


    ![Container Instance IP](images/02-public-IP.png)

    Run the same curl command as before (or view the endpoint in your browser) and ensure that you get a list of Mysfits in the response.

    <details>
    <summary>HINT: curl refresher</summary>
    <pre>
    $ curl http://<b><i>TASK_PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS</i></b>/mysfits
    </pre>
    </details>

    Navigate to the [CloudWatch Logs dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home#logs:), and click on the monolith log group (e.g.: `mysfits-MythicalMonolithLogGroup-LVZJ0H2I2N4`).  Logging statements are written to log streams within the log group.  Click on the most recent log stream to view the logs.  The output should look very familiar from your testing in Lab 1.

    ![CloudWatch Log Entries](images/02-cloudwatch-logs.png)

    If the curl command was successful, stop the task by going to your cluster, select the **Tasks** tab, select the running monolith task, and click **Stop**.

### Checkpoint:
Nice work!  You've created a task definition and are able to deploy the monolith container using ECS.  You've also enabled logging to CloudWatch Logs, so you can verify your container works as expected.

[*^ back to the top*](#monolith-to-microservices-with-docker-and-aws-fargate)

## Lab 3 - Scale the adoption platform monolith with an ALB

The Run Task method you used in the last lab is good for testing, but we need to run the adoption platform as a long running process.

In this lab, you will use an Elastic Load Balancing [Appliction Load Balancer (ALB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) to distribute incoming requests to your running containers. In addition to simple load balancing, this provieds capabilities like path-based routing to different services.

What ties this all together is an **ECS Service**, which maintains a desired task count (i.e. n number of containers as long running processes) and integrates with the ALB (i.e. handles registration/deregistration of containers to the ALB). An initial ECS service and ALB were created for you by CloudFormation at the beginning of the workshop. In this lab, you'll update those resources to host the containerized monolith service. Later, you'll make a new service from scratch once we break apart the monolith.

![Lab 3 Architecture](images/03-arch.png)


### Instructions:

1. Test the placeholder service:

    The CloudFormation stack you launched at the beginning of the workshop included an ALB in front of a placeholder ECS service running a simple container with the NGINX web server. Find the hostname for this ALB in the "LoadBalancerDNS" output variable in the `cfn-output.json` file, and verify that you can load the NGINX default page:

    ![NGINX default page](images/03-nginx.png)


3. Update the service to use your task definition:

    Find the ECS cluster named <code>Cluster-<i><b>STACK_NAME</b></i></code>, then select the service named <code><b><i>STACK_NAME</i></b>-MythicalMonolithService-XXX</code> and click "Update" in the upper right:

    ![update service](images/03-update-service.png)

    Update the Task Definition to the revision you created in the previous lab, then click through the rest of the screens and update the service.

4. Test the functionality of the website:

    You can monitor the progress of the deployment on the "Tasks" tab of the service page:

    ![monitoring the update](images/03-deployment.png)

    The update is fully deployed once there is just one instance of the Task running the latest revision:

    ![fully deployed](images/03-fully-deployed.png)

    Visit the S3 static site for the Mythical Mysfits (which was empty earlier) and you should now see the page filled with Mysfits once your update is fully deployed. Remember you can access the website at <code>http://<b><i>BUCKET_NAME</i></b>.s3-website.<b><i>REGION</i></b>.amazonaws.com/</code> where the bucket name can be found in the `workshop-1/cfn-output.json` file:

    ![the functional website](images/03-website.png)

    Click the heart icon to like a Mysfit, then click the Mysfit to see a detailed profile, and ensure that the like count has incremented:

    ![like functionality](images/03-like-count.png)

    This ensures that the monolith can read from and write to DynamoDB, and that it can process likes. Check the CloudWatch logs from ECS and ensure that you can see the "Like processed." message in the logs:

    ![like logs](images/03-like-processed.png)

<details>
<summary>INFO: What is a service and how does it differ from a task??</summary>

An [ECS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html) is a concept where ECS allows you to run and maintain a specified number (the "desired count") of instances of a task definition simultaneously in an ECS cluster.


tl;dr a **Service** is comprised of multiple **tasks** and will keep them up and running. See the link above for more detail.

</details>

### Checkpoint:
Sweet! Now you have a load-balanced ECS service managing your containerized Mythical Mysfits application. It's still a single monolith container, but we'll work on breaking it down next.

[*^ back to the top*](#monolith-to-microservices-with-docker-and-aws-fargate)

## Lab 4: Incrementally build and deploy each microservice using Fargate

It's time to break apart the monolithic adoption into microservices. To help with this, let's see how the monolith works in more detail.

> The monolith serves up several different API resources on different routes to fetch info about Mysfits, "like" them, or adopt them.
>
> The logic for these resources generally consists of some "processing" (like ensuring that the user is allowed to take a particular action, that a Mysfit is eligible for adoption, etc) and some interaction with the persistence layer, which in this case is DynamoDB.

> It is often a bad idea to have many different services talking directly to a single database (adding indexes and doing data migrations is hard enough with just one application), so rather than split off all of the logic of a given resource into a separate service, we'll start by moving only the "processing" business logic into a separate service and continue to use the monolith as a facade in front of the database. This is sometimes described as the [Strangler Application pattern](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerApplication.html), as we're "strangling" the monolith out of the picture and only continuing to use it for the parts that are toughest to move out until it can be fully replaced.

> The ALB has another feature called [path-based routing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/load-balancer-listeners.html#path-conditions), which routes traffic based on URL path to particular target groups.  This means you will only need a single instance of the ALB to host your microservices.  The monolith service will receive all traffic to the default path, '/'.  Adoption and like services will be '/adopt' and '/like', respectively.

Here's what you will be implementing:

![Lab 4](images/04-arch.png)

*Note: The green tasks denote the monolith and the orange tasks denote the "like" microservice

    
As with the monolith, you'll be using [Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) to deploy these microservices, but this time we'll walk through all the deployment steps for a fresh service.

### Instructions:

1. First, we need to add some glue code in the monolith to support moving the "like" function into a separate service. You'll use your Cloud9 environment to do this.  If you've closed the tab, go to the [Cloud9 Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/home) and find your environment. Click "**Open IDE**". Find the `app/monolith-service/service/mythicalMysfitsService.py` source file, and uncomment the following section:

    ```
    # @app.route("/mysfits/<mysfit_id>/fulfill-like", methods=['POST'])
    # def fulfillLikeMysfit(mysfit_id):
    #     serviceResponse = mysfitsTableClient.likeMysfit(mysfit_id)
    #     flaskResponse = Response(serviceResponse)
    #     flaskResponse.headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
    #     return flaskResponse
    ```

    This provides an endpoint that can still manage persistence to DynamoDB, but omits the "business logic" (okay, in this case it's just a print statement, but in real life it could involve permissions checks or other nontrivial processing) handled by the `process_like_request` function.

2. With this new functionality added to the monolith, rebuild the monolith docker image with a new tag, such as `nolike`, and push it to ECR just as before (It is a best practice to avoid the `latest` tag, which can be ambiguous. Instead choose a unique, descriptive name, or even better user a Git SHA and/or build ID):

    <pre>
    $ cd app/monolith-service
    $ docker build -t monolith-service:nolike .
    $ docker tag monolith-service:nolike <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:nolike
    $ docker push <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:nolike
    </pre>

3. Now, just as in Lab 2, create a new revision of the monolith Task Definition (this time pointing to the "nolike" version of the container image), AND update the monolith service to use this revision as you did in Lab 3.

4. Now, build the like service and push it to ECR.

    To find the like-service ECR repo URI, navigate to [Repositories](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/repositories) in the ECS dashboard, and find the repo named like <code><b><i>STACK_NAME</i></b>-like-XXX</code>.  Click on the like-service repository and copy the repository URI.

    ![Getting Like Service Repo](images/04-ecr-like.png)

    *Note: Your URI will be unique.*

    <pre>
    $ cd app/like-service
    $ docker build -t like-service .
    $ docker tag like-service:latest <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:latest
    $ docker push <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:latest
    </pre>

5. Create a new **Task Definition** for the like service using the image pushed to ECR.

    Navigate to [Task Definitions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home#/taskDefinitions) in the ECS dashboard. Click on **Create New Task Definition**.

    Select **Fargate** launch type, and click **Next step**.

    Enter a name for your Task Definition, e.g. mysfits-like.

    In the "[Task execution IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_execution_IAM_role.html)" section, Fargate needs an IAM role to be able to pull container images and log to CloudWatch.  Select the role named like <code><b><i>STACK_NAME</i></b>-EcsServiceRole-XXXXX</code> that was already created for the monolith service.

    The "[Task size](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html#task_size)" section lets you specify the total cpu and memory used for the task. This is different from the container-specific cpu and memory values, which you will also configure when adding the container definition.

    Select **0.5GB** for **Task memory (GB)** and select **0.25vCPU** for **Task CPU (vCPU)**.

    Your progress should look similar to this:

    ![Fargate Task Definition](images/04-taskdef.png)

    Click **Add container** to associate the like service container with the task.

    Enter values for the following fields:

    * **Container name** - this is a logical identifier, not the name of the container image (e.g. `mysfits-like`).
    * **Image** - this is a reference to the container image stored in ECR.  The format should be the same value you used to push the like service container to ECR - <pre><b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:latest</pre>
    * **Port mapping** - set the container port to be `80`.

    Here's an example:

    ![Fargate like service container definition](images/04-containerdef.png)

    *Note: Notice you didn't have to specify the host port because Fargate uses the awsvpc network mode. Depending on the launch type (EC2 or Fargate), some task definition parameters are required and some are optional. You can learn more from our [task definition documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definitions.html).*

    The like service code is designed to call an endpoint on the monolith to persist data to DynamoDB. It references an environment variable called `MONOLITH_URL` to know where to send fulfillment.

    Scroll down to the "Advanced container configuration" section, and in the "Environment" section, create an environment variable using `MONOLITH_URL` for the key. For the value, enter the **ALB DNS name** that currently fronts the monolith.

    Here's an example (make sure you enter just the hostname like `alb-mysfits-1892029901.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com` without any "http" or slashes):

    ![monolith env var](images/04-env-var.png)

    Fargate conveniently enables logging to CloudWatch for you.  Keep the default log settings and take note of the **awslogs-group** and the **awslogs-stream-prefix**, so you can find the logs for this task later.

    Here's an example:

    ![Fargate logging](images/04-logging.png)

    Click **Add** to associate the container definition, and click **Create** to create the task definition.

6. Create an ECS service to run the Like Service task definition you just created and associate it with the existing ALB.

    Navigate to the new revision of the Like task definition you just created.  Under the **Actions** drop down, choose **Create Service**.

    Configure the following fields:

    * **Launch type** - select **Fargate**
    * **Cluster** - select your workshop ECS cluster
    * **Service name** - enter a name for the service (e.g. `mysfits-like-service`)
    * **Number of tasks** - enter `1`.

    Here's an example:

    ![ECS Service](images/04-ecs-service-step1.png)

    Leave other settings as defaults and click **Next Step**

    Since the task definition uses awsvpc network mode, you can choose which VPC and subnet(s) to host your tasks.

    For **Cluster VPC**, select your workshop VPC.  And for **Subnets**, select the private subnets; you can identify these based on the tags.

    Leave the default security group which allows inbound port 80.  If you had your own security groups defined in the VPC, you could assign them here.

    Here's an example:

    ![ECS Service VPC](images/04-ecs-service-vpc.png)

    Scroll down to "Load balancing" and select **Application Load Balancer** for *Load balancer type*.

    You'll see a **Load balancer name** drop-down menu appear.  Select the same Mythical Mysfits ALB used for the monolith ECS service.

    In the "Container to load balance" section, select the **Container name : port** combo from the drop-down menu that corresponds to the like service task definition.

    Your progress should look similar to this:

    ![ECS Load Balancing](images/04-ecs-service-alb.png)

    Click **Add to load balancer** to reveal more settings.

    For the **Production listener Port**, select **80:HTTP** from the drop-down.

    For the **Target Group Name**, you'll need to create a new group for the Like containers, so leave it as "create new" and replace the auto-generated value with `mysfits-like`.  This is a friendly name to identify the target group, so any value that relates to the Like microservice will do.

    Change the path pattern to `/mysfits/*/like`.  The ALB uses this path to route traffic to the like service target group.  This is how multiple services are being served from the same ALB listener.  Note the existing default path routes to the monolith target group.

    For **Evaluation order** enter `1`.  Edit the **Health check path** to be `/`.

    And finally, uncheck **Enable service discovery integration**.  While public namespaces are supported, a public zone needs to be configured in Route53 first.  Consider this convenient feature for your own services, and you can read more about [service discovery](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-discovery.html) in our documentation.

    Your configuration should look similar to this:

    ![Like Service](images/04-ecs-service-alb-detail.png)

    Leave the other fields as defaults and click **Next Step**.

    Skip the Auto Scaling configuration by clicking **Next Step**.

    Click **Create Service** on the Review page.

    Once the Service is created, click **View Service** and you'll see your task definition has been deployed as a service.  It starts out in the **PROVISIONING** state, progresses to the **PENDING** state, and if your configuration is successful, the service will finally enter the **RUNNING** state.  You can see these state changes by periodically click on the refresh button.

7. Once the new like service is deployed, test liking a Mysfit again by visiting the website. Check the CloudWatch logs again and make sure that the like service now shows a "Like processed." message. If you see this, you have succesfully factored out like functionality into the new microservice!

8. If you have time, you can now remove the old like endpoint from the monolith now that it is no longer seeing production use.

    Go back to your Cloud9 environment where you built the monolith and like service container images.

    In the monolith folder, open mythicalMysfitsService.py in the Cloud9 editor and find the code that reads:

    ```
    # increment the number of likes for the provided mysfit.
    @app.route("/mysfits/<mysfit_id>/like", methods=['POST'])
    def likeMysfit(mysfit_id):
        serviceResponse = mysfitsTableClient.likeMysfit(mysfit_id)
        process_like_request()
        flaskResponse = Response(serviceResponse)
        flaskResponse.headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
        return flaskResponse
    ```
    Once you find that line, you can delete it or comment it out.

    *Tip: if you're not familiar with Python, you can comment out a line by adding a hash character, "#", at the beginning of the line.*

9. Build, tag and push the monolith image to the monolith ECR repository.

    Use the tag `nolike2` now instead of `nolike`.

    <pre>
    $ docker build -t monolith-service:nolike2 .
    $ docker tag monolith-service:nolike <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:nolike2
    $ docker push <b><i>ECR_REPOSITORY_URI</i></b>:nolike2
    </pre>

    If you look at the monolith repository in ECR, you'll see the pushed image tagged as `nolike2`:

    ![ECR nolike image](images/04-ecr-nolike2.png)

10. Now make one last Task Definition for the monolith to refer to this new container image URI (this process should be familiar now, and you can probably see that it makes sense to leave this drudgery to a CI/CD service in production), update the monolith service to use the new Task Definition, and make sure the app still functions as before.

### Checkpoint:
Congratulations, you've successfully rolled out the like microservice from the monolith.  If you have time, try repeating this lab to break out the adoption microservice.  Otherwise, please remember to follow the steps below in the **Workshop Cleanup** to make sure all assets created during the workshop are removed so you do not see unexpected charges after today.

## Workshop Cleanup

This is really important because if you leave stuff running in your account, it will continue to generate charges.  Certain things were created by CloudFormation and certain things were created manually throughout the workshop.  Follow the steps below to make sure you clean up properly.

Delete manually created resources throughout the labs:

* ECS service(s) - first update the desired task count to be 0.  Then delete the ECS service itself.
* ECR - delete any Docker images pushed to your ECR repository.
* CloudWatch logs groups
* ALBs and associated target groups

Finally, [delete the CloudFormation stack](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-console-delete-stack.html) launched at the beginning of the workshop to clean up the rest.  If the stack deletion process encountered errors, look at the Events tab in the CloudFormation dashboard, and you'll see what steps failed.  It might just be a case where you need to clean up a manually created asset that is tied to a resource goverened by CloudFormation.
